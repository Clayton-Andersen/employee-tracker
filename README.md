## Installation
You'll need to be able to access mysql so be sure to start by creating an account if you don't already have one set up. Clone down the repo and edit the password in the connection.js file to match your mysql password; the application will not work if this step isn't completed. With node packages installed, use the navigation from the root directory to start the application by typing: node index.js and press enter. This appliaction is now running and you'll be prompted with a series of questions.
